Serializers are used to convert complex data types, such as queryset instances or model instances, into native Python data types that can be easily rendered into JSON, XML, or other content types.
They are primarily used for converting database records (e.g., Django model instances) into JSON data that can be sent over the network as a response to an API request.
Serializers also handle validation of incoming data during deserialization (i.e., converting request data into Python objects).
Deserializers:
Deserializers, sometimes referred to as parsers, are used for the opposite operation of serializers. They convert incoming request data (e.g., JSON or XML) into native Python data types that can be processed by Django views and stored in the database.
Deserializers are used primarily for handling incoming data in API requests and converting it into Django model instances or other Python objects that can be saved to the database.
Deserializers also handle validation of incoming data to ensure it meets the requirements specified by the application's data models.



ctrl and / would comment everything

many to many relationship
many to one relationship
one to one relationship

if you have this message after editing your model and running migration 
Provide a one-off default now (will be set on all existing rows with a null value for this column)
 2) Quit and manually define a default value in models.py.

if you go to headers you can see everything that you need to do such as post, delete, patch, put etc

to update go to 

http://127.0.0.1:8000/streamviewset/4/ Note that if you dont add /after the id (4) it would give an error

it would display this 
{
    "id": 4,
    "name": "Netflix",
    "about": "The netflix",
    "website": "http://mevab.com"
}


then select put then select body then raw and select json

    "name": "Netflix",
    "about": "The netflix updated",
    "website": "http://mevab.com"
}

TO SEND A POST REQUEST GO TO http://127.0.0.1:8000/streamviewset/
CHANGE IT BACK TO GET WHICH would list all the stream list and then click on send

type 
{
    "name": "DaZone",
    "about": "The nedazone site",
    "website": "http://mevab.com"
}
change it to POST

then click on post to add new watchlist


to delete go to the url http://127.0.0.1:8000/streamviewset/5/
then click get and click send to display it

then select delete and click send


Global level persmision in settings
 # with this users needs to be authenticated before they can access the apis
 # this is a global level 

# REST_FRAMEWORK = {
#     'DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES': [
#         'rest_framework.permissions.IsAuthenticated'
#     ]
# }

#IsAdminUser wouldallow only admins. for more permisions go to https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/permissions/#isadminuser
# REST_FRAMEWORK = {
#     'DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES': [
#         'rest_framework.permissions.IsAdminUser'
#     ]
# }


for object level persmision you need to write them in the DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES


if you add this permisions to any function or class then its an object level persmision
on this url you would see other permisions https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/permissions/#isadminuser
class ReviewList(generics.ListCreateAPIView):
    queryset = Review.objects.all()
    serializer_class = ReviewSerializer
    permission_classes = [IsAuthenticated]




Authentication


add this to your settings.py which was gotten from https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/authentication/


REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': [
        'rest_framework.authentication.BasicAuthentication',
        'rest_framework.authentication.SessionAuthentication',
    ]
}

remove the session authentication


REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': [
        'rest_framework.authentication.BasicAuthentication',
        
    ]
}

if you want to use permision and authentication then add them together
if you repreat the rest_framework the second would override the first


 REST_FRAMEWORK = {
     'DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES': [
         'rest_framework.permissions.IsAdminUser'
     ],
        'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': [
            'rest_framework.authentication.BasicAuthentication',
        
    ]

 }
