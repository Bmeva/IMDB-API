Serializers are used to convert complex data types, such as queryset instances or model instances, into native Python data types that can be easily rendered into JSON, XML, or other content types.
They are primarily used for converting database records (e.g., Django model instances) into JSON data that can be sent over the network as a response to an API request.
Serializers also handle validation of incoming data during deserialization (i.e., converting request data into Python objects).
Deserializers:
Deserializers, sometimes referred to as parsers, are used for the opposite operation of serializers. They convert incoming request data (e.g., JSON or XML) into native Python data types that can be processed by Django views and stored in the database.
Deserializers are used primarily for handling incoming data in API requests and converting it into Django model instances or other Python objects that can be saved to the database.
Deserializers also handle validation of incoming data to ensure it meets the requirements specified by the application's data models.
